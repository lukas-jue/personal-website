I am a Ph.D. Student and Research Assistant in Quantitative Marketing at
Goethe University Frankfurt. My research focuses on the interface
between Data Science and Marketing. I like applying modern econometric
methods to novel data sources in the digital economy---especially with
the `R` programming language.

In my research project [Measuring Self-Preferencing on Digital
Platforms](research.qmd#research.html#measuring-self-preferencing-on-digital-platforms),
we develop an approach to test for self-preferencing through platform recommendations.

Just published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization---"[Do Political Conflicts Influence Daily
Consumption
Choices?](research.qmd#do-political-conflicts-influence-daily-consumption-choices)"---combines
vast smartphone location data and textual analysis of newspaper articles
to assess the impact of political conflict on consumption.

For the newest project, we created a Generative AI app that provide personalized
feedback to students. In the paper
[Generative AI for Scalable Feedback to Multimodal Exercises in Marketing Analytics](research.html#generative-ai-for-scalable-feedback-to-multimodal-exercises-in-marketing-analytics)
we describe how well that works (spoiler: quite well!)

I am an expert in the `R` programming language and love
[teaching](teaching.qmd) `R` to Bachelor's, Master's and Ph.D. students,
using the language in my [research](research.qmd), and even for
designing this website.

In my free time, I help preparing the next generation for the digital
future as a member of the supervisory board at TechAcademy e.V., a non-profit
organization teaching coding and promoting tech literacy.

On this website, you will find information about my Academic
[Research](research.qmd) and [Teaching](teaching.qmd), my [Curriculum
Vitae](curriculum-vitae.qmd), and my passion project---[TechAcademy
e.V.](techacademy.qmd).
