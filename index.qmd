I am a Ph.D. Student and Research Assistant in Quantitative Marketing at Goethe University Frankfurt. My research focuses on the interface between Data Science and Marketing. I like applying modern econometric methods to novel data sources in the digital economy---especially with the `R` programming language.

In my research project [Measuring Fair Competition on Digital Platforms](research.qmd#research.html#measuring-fair-competition-on-digital-platforms), we develop an approach to test for fair competition on digital platforms. Combining extensive data from Amazon's search results with high-frequency Amazon product data, we describe a toolkit for regulators and researchers to test for potentially anti-competitive recommendations on digital platforms.

Another research project---[Does Media Reporting Matter for Daily Consumption Choices?](https://lukas-juergensmeier.com/research.html#does-media-reporting-matter-for-daily-consumption-choices)---combines vast smartphone location data and textual analysis of newspaper articles to assess the impact of media on consumption.

I am an expert in the `R` programming language and love [teaching](teaching.qmd) `R` to Bachelor's, Master's and Ph.D. students, using the language in my [research](research.qmd), and even for designing this website.

In my free time, I enjoy preparing the next generation for the digital future as a Member of the Board at TechAcademy e.V., a non-profit organization teaching coding and promoting tech literacy.

On this website, you will find information about my Academic [Research](research.qmd) and [Teaching](teaching.qmd), my [Curriculum Vitae](curriculum-vitae.qmd), and my passion project---[TechAcademy e.V.](techacademy.qmd).
