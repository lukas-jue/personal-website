I am a Ph.D. Student and Research Associate in Quantitative Marketing at
Goethe University Frankfurt. My research and teaching focuses on the interface
between Data Science and Marketing. I like applying modern econometric
methods to novel data sources in the digital economy---and teach students
how to do that with `R` and `Python`.

In my research project [Measuring Self-Preferencing on Digital Platforms](research.html#measuring-self-preferencing-on-digital-platforms),
we develop an approach to test for self-preferencing through platform recommendations.

"[Do Political Conflicts Influence Daily
Consumption
Choices?](research.qmd#do-political-conflicts-influence-daily-consumption-choices)"---published in the *Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization*---combines
vast smartphone location data and textual analysis of newspaper articles
to assess the impact of political conflict on consumption.

For the newest project, we created a Generative AI app that provide personalized
feedback to students. Published in the *International Journal of Research in Marketing,*
[Generative AI for Scalable Feedback to Multimodal Exercises](research.html#generative-ai-for-scalable-feedback-to-multimodal-exercises)
describes how well that works (spoiler: quite well!)

My [teaching](teaching.qmd) experience includes:

1. Designing and teaching *Introduction to Data Science* courses in `R` and `Python` for students from all fields,
2. Teaching a *Marketing Analytics* course that enables students to solve marketing problems with econometrics, programming, and substantive marketing skills,
3. Teaching an *Empirical Customer Analytics* seminar about machine learning methods in marketing analytics, and
4. Designing and teaching TechAcademy's blended learning *Data Science with R* courses.

In my free time, I help preparing the next generation for the digital
future as a member of the supervisory board at TechAcademy e.V., a non-profit
organization teaching coding and promoting tech literacy.

On this website, you will find information about my Academic
[Research](research.qmd) and [Teaching](teaching.qmd), my [Curriculum
Vitae](curriculum-vitae.qmd), and my passion project---[TechAcademy
e.V.](techacademy.qmd)
