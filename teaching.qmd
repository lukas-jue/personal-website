title: "Teaching"

My teaching focuses on programming with R and applied econometrics in
Marketing. I aim to convey a valuable data science toolkit that enables
students to answer complex economic or business questions with data and
statistics.

To convey the---sometimes technical and challenging---programming and
statistical methods, I follow a teaching philosophy that avoids
teacher's monologues in lengthy lectures but instead forces students to
*get their hands dirty* quickly and learn by doing. Hence, my courses
involve short primers on technical concepts but heavily rely on the
students working in small groups to solve small case studies. From my
experience, students learn (sometimes challenging) topics such as
programming and statistics in a more motivating and effective way.

Below, you will find my teaching portfolio and links to my teaching
materials.

## Course Objective

Most academic fields require proficiency in at least one data-centered
analysis tool. For many, the R programming language has become the tool
of choice. However, the first steps in coding can be intimidating and
discouraging---primarily if you have never worked with a programming
language before. This course aims to provide a results-oriented,
applied, and hands-on introduction to the essential parts of a Data
Science project in R. We will introduce the libraries and frameworks
necessary for your analysis and focus on teaching you the implementation
and application of those tools. We'll present small examples throughout
the lecture and provide you with application exercises that you can work
on for yourself.

We aim to show you the scope of possibilities within R and leave you
with the impression that you can confidently implement your empirical
projects in R. We will focus on the Tidyverse ecosystem, a consistent
and intuitive framework for building your data analysis from start to
finish. After completing this course, you know how to apply the
essential Tidyverse tools for everyday Data Science tasks in
R---primarily data wrangling, data visualization, and communicating
results.

## Course Description

We aim this course at beginners who are either entirely new to R as a
programming language and/or want to learn about the Tidyverse ecosystem.
The course covers four primary areas of the typical data science process
and introduces the respective `tidyverse` tools:

-   Plotting with `ggplot2`
-   Data wrangling with `dplyr`
-   Communicating your results with R Markdown
-   Regressions with `tidymodels`

We will not cover statistical or theoretical concepts in this course, as
the focus will lie on applied coding.

## Methods

We will *let you eat cake first*. What does that mean? Many programming
courses start with the absolute basics --- variable types, syntax,
loops, etc. Those are important but quite dull in the beginning. Instead
of monotonously walking you through those, we follow a different
teaching philosophy.

Each topic will start with a very friendly and sometimes a bit
complicated *cake*. And you will dive right into it by executing and
adapting the code for that "data science cake."

For example, we will show you an advanced visualization right at the
beginning of the course and focus on what is possible eventually. While
this might appear intimidating at first (*"how should I ever be able to
code that from scratch?"*), we will walk you through the steps and
introduce the methods to get there during the course.

The course will alternate between short introductions to a concept or
method and small do-it-yourself coding exercises. In between the three
sessions, you are encouraged to work on provided exercises that further
deepen your understanding.

## Course Description

This course teaches around 200 students per semester the basics of data
analysis with the software R. We aim to enable the students with a
valuable toolkit to answer data-driven economic questions with a modern
Data Science toolkit. The course follows the *Flipped Classroom*
principle.

We provide the course content in videos "on-demand" before the
face-to-face classroom session. Students watch the videos before coming
to class and hence learn theoretical concepts. We then build upon that
foundation and use the face-to-face time in class to deepen students'
understanding. In particular, we fully allocate the time in class for
interaction in the form of small 60-minutes hands-on data science
exercises in small groups and effective Q&A sessions.

## Course Description

This course teaches students to analyze real-world banking customer data
with common marketing analytics methods. We teach methodological skills,
including regression-based (e.g., linear and logistic regressions) and
machine learning methods (e.g., random forests), and their
implementation in `R`. Beyond teaching technical skills, this course
focuses on enabling students to make data-driven marketing decisions in
a relevant business setting. We analyze real (anonymized) customer data
from one of the largest German banks.

We organize the course along the customer life cycle:

-   *The acquisition of new customers:* Analysis of acquisition channels
    and their efficiency and optimization of the conversion "funnel."

-   *The development from one-off to serial customers*: understanding
    cross-selling and optimizing sales in the customer base.

-   *The collection and analysis of customer feedback* to better
    understand customer satisfaction.

-   *The analysis and prevention of cancellations* (churn) to avoid
    cancellations and implement active cancellation prevention.

This course investigates these phases by empirically analyzing real
banking customer data, including:

-   The exploration and preparation of data through exploratory data
    analysis and necessary data wrangling.

-   The analysis of log files and associated basic data analysis in
    e-commerce.

-   The analysis of purchase and cancellation behavior using suitable
    (regression-based) methods.

-   The analysis of customer feedback from web portals through basic
    text mining techniques.

# TechAcademy

At TechAcademy, we teach coding in Data Science with R and Python, Web
Development, and App Development to university students from all fields
and previous experiences. We do so using an innovative blended learning
approach that combines e-learning courses with offline Coding Meetups,
group projects, a strong community, and individualized support from
mentors.

Before joining the executive board of the non-profit organization, I led
the organization's data science and learning development team. Together
with that team, we developed the innovative learning concept that
significantly lowers the entry barrier to coding education and opens
once closed (career) opportunities for students---especially from fields
other than computer science.
