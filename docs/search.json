This manuscript evaluates how well Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides automated feedback on complex multimodal exercises requiring coding, statistics, and economic reasoning. Besides providing this technology through an easily accessible web application, this article evaluates the technology’s performance by comparing the quantitative feedback (i.e., points achieved) from Generative AI models with human expert feedback for 4,349 solutions to marketing analytics exercises. The results show that automated feedback produced by Generative AI (GPT-4) provides almost unbiased evaluations while correlating highly with (r = 0.94) and deviating only 6 % from human evaluations. GPT-4 performs best among seven Generative AI models, albeit at the highest cost. Comparing the models’ performance with costs shows that GPT-4, Mistral Large, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.0 Pro dominate three other Generative AI models (Claude 3 Sonnet, GPT-3.5, and Gemini 1.5 Pro). Expert assessment of the qualitative feedback (i.e., the AI’s textual response) indicates that it is mostly correct, sufficient, and appropriate for learners. A survey of marketing analytics learners shows that they highly recommend the app and its Generative AI feedback. An advantage of the app is its subject-agnosticism—it does not require any subject- or exercise-specific training. Thus, it is immediately usable for new exercises in marketing analytics and other subjects.\nKeywords: Generative AI, Automated Feedback, App, Marketing Analytics, Learning."

We exploit the volatile US-China relations in 2018 and 2019 to analyze whether US consumers reduce their visits to Chinese restaurants when bilateral relations deteriorate. We measure the degree of political conflict through negativity in media reports and rely on smartphone location data to measure daily visits to over 190,000 US restaurants. A deterioration in US-China relations induces a significant decline in visits not only to Chinese but also to other foreign ethnic restaurants, while visits to typical American restaurants increase. We identify consumers’ age, race, and cultural openness to moderate the strength of this ethnocentric effect.\nKeywords: Political conflict, Consumption, Boycotts, Ethnocentrism"

In online marketplaces, also called retail or e-commerce platforms, much of the academic and regulatory debate focuses on determining whether the marketplace provider gives preference to its own private labels, such as “Amazon Basics” or Walmart’s “Great Value” products. However, we outline, both conceptually and empirically, that self-preferencing can also occur through other dimensions of vertical integration—namely, retailing and fulfillment. This article contributes by conceptualizing three dimensions of vertical integration in online marketplaces—private labels, retailing, and fulfillment. Then, two studies empirically assess (i) which of the 20 most-visited global online marketplaces vertically integrate which dimension and (ii) which share of 600 million available offers are vertically integrated to which degree in eleven international Amazon marketplaces. The majority of the leading marketplaces vertically integrate all three dimensions, implying ample opportunities for self-preferencing. Across international Amazon marketplaces, only 0.02% of available offers consist of an Amazon private-label product. However, Amazon is a retailer for around 31% and fulfills around 38% of all available offers in its marketplaces. Hence, self-preferencing on Amazon can occur most frequently through retailing and fulfillment but comparatively infrequently through private-label offers. Still, these shares differ substantially by country—every second offer is vertically integrated in the US, but only one in ten in India. Most of the self-preferencing debate often focuses on private-label products. Instead, we present large-scale empirical results showing that self-preferencing on Amazon could occur most often through retailing and fulfillment because these channels affect much larger shares of offers. We also measure the variation of these shares across countries and relate them to regulatory environments."

This case study combines teaching econometrics to analyze data and substantive marketing to derive managerial insights. The econometric challenge requires students to set up and implement a regression analysis to derive the demand function, detect multicollinearity, and select appropriate data visualizations. The substantive challenge requires deriving optimal pricing decisions and understanding how the parameters of the demand function impact optimal prices and the associated profit. We test the case study in a marketing analytics exam and discuss the performance of 134 students. Beyond assessing student performance in an exam, the case study facilitates teaching through in-class group work or assignments. Free of charge, under a liberal CC BY license, we encourage other educators to use the case study in their teaching. We provide the necessary data and a sample solution using the statistical programming language R.\nKeywords: Marketing Analytics, Pricing, Teaching, Education, Case Study, Data Science"

    "text": "Measuring Self-Preferencing on Digital Platforms\nAuthors: Lukas Jürgensmeier and Bernd Skiera.\nStatus: Under third-round review at the Journal of Marketing.\nRead the full working paper on SSRN.\nAbstract\nDigital platforms use recommendations to facilitate exchanges between platform actors, such as trade between buyers and sellers. Aiming to protect consumers and guarantee fair competition on platforms, legislators increasingly require that recommendations on market-dominating platforms be free from self-preferencing. That is, platforms that also act as sellers (e.g., Amazon) or information providers (e.g., Google) must not prefer their own offers over comparable third-party offers. Yet, successful enforcement of self-preferencing bans—to the potential benefit of consumers and third-party actors—requires defining and measuring self-preferencing across a platform. In the context of recommendations through search results, this research contributes by i) conceptualizing a “recommendation” as an offer’s level of search engine visibility across an entire platform (instead of its position in specific search queries, as in previous research); ii) discussing two tests for self-preferencing, and iii) implementing them in two empirical studies across three international Amazon marketplaces. Contrary to consumer expectations and emerging literature, our analysis finds almost no evidence for self-preferencing. A survey reveals that even if Amazon were proven to engage in self-preferencing, most consumers would not change their shopping behavior on the platform—highlighting Amazon’s significant market power and suggesting the need for robust protections for sellers and consumers.\nKeywords: Digital Platforms, Amazon, Competition, Antitrust, Search Engines, Digital Markets Act, American Innovation and Choice Online Act."

However, obtaining and processing such data is cumbersome, and either involves web scraping or access to a pre-existing database. One such a database is the commercial data provider Keepa.com, which tracks Amazon products over time. While such database is accessible via API, identifying and processing the relevant data—into a suitable format for social science research—requires significant effort. This article introduces the keepar package, an R package designed to simplify this data acquisition and transformation process. Through an illustrative research project analyzing the market for rubber ducks on Amazon, this article explains how to use the package to obtain and transform the Keepa.com data. Making this package available open source, this article contributes to making this data source more widely available to social science researchers."

    "text": "My teaching focuses on programming with R and applied econometrics in Marketing. I aim to convey a valuable data science toolkit that enables students to answer complex economic or business questions with data and statistics.\nTo convey the—sometimes technical and challenging—programming and statistical methods, I follow a teaching philosophy that avoids teacher’s monologues in lengthy lectures but instead forces students to get their hands dirty quickly and learn by doing. Hence, my courses involve short primers on technical concepts but heavily rely on the students working in small groups to solve small case studies. From my experience, students learn (sometimes challenging) topics such as programming and statistics in a more motivating and effective way.\nBelow, you will find my teaching portfolio and links to my teaching materials."

    "text": "Course Objective\nMost academic fields require proficiency in at least one data-centered analysis tool. For many, the R programming language has become the tool of choice. However, the first steps in coding can be intimidating and discouraging—primarily if you have never worked with a programming language before. This course aims to provide a results-oriented, applied, and hands-on introduction to the essential parts of a Data Science project in R. We will introduce the libraries and frameworks necessary for your analysis and focus on teaching you the implementation and application of those tools. We’ll present small examples throughout the lecture and provide you with application exercises that you can work on for yourself.\nWe aim to show you the scope of possibilities within R and leave you with the impression that you can confidently implement your empirical projects in R. We will focus on the Tidyverse ecosystem, a consistent and intuitive framework for building your data analysis from start to finish. After completing this course, you know how to apply the essential Tidyverse tools for everyday Data Science tasks in R—primarily data wrangling, data visualization, and communicating results."

The course covers four primary areas of the typical data science process and introduces the respective tidyverse tools:\n\nPlotting with ggplot2\nData wrangling with dplyr\nCommunicating your results with R Markdown\nRegressions with tidymodels\n\nWe will not cover statistical or theoretical concepts in this course, as the focus will lie on applied coding."

Many programming courses start with the absolute basics — variable types, syntax, loops, etc. Those are important but quite dull in the beginning. Instead of monotonously walking you through those, we follow a different teaching philosophy.\nEach topic will start with a very friendly and sometimes a bit complicated cake. And you will dive right into it by executing and adapting the code for that “data science cake.”\nFor example, we will show you an advanced visualization right at the beginning of the course and focus on what is possible eventually. While this might appear intimidating at first (“how should I ever be able to code that from scratch?”), we will walk you through the steps and introduce the methods to get there during the course.\nThe course will alternate between short introductions to a concept or method and small do-it-yourself coding exercises. In between the three sessions, you are encouraged to work on provided exercises that further deepen your understanding."

We aim to enable the students with a valuable toolkit to answer data-driven economic questions with a modern Data Science toolkit. The course follows the Flipped Classroom principle.\nWe provide the course content in videos “on-demand” before the face-to-face classroom session. Students watch the videos before coming to class and hence learn theoretical concepts. We then build upon that foundation and use the face-to-face time in class to deepen students’ understanding. In particular, we fully allocate the time in class for interaction in the form of small 60-minutes hands-on data science exercises in small groups and effective Q&A sessions."

We teach methodological skills, including regression-based (e.g., linear and logistic regressions) and machine learning methods (e.g., random forests), and their implementation in R. Beyond teaching technical skills, this course focuses on enabling students to make data-driven marketing decisions in a relevant business setting. We analyze real (anonymized) customer data from one of the largest German banks.\nWe organize the course along the customer life cycle:\n\nThe acquisition of new customers: Analysis of acquisition channels and their efficiency and optimization of the conversion “funnel.”\nThe development from one-off to serial customers: understanding cross-selling and optimizing sales in the customer base.\nThe collection and analysis of customer feedback to better understand customer satisfaction.\nThe analysis and prevention of cancellations (churn) to avoid cancellations and implement active cancellation prevention.\n\nThis course investigates these phases by empirically analyzing real banking customer data, including:\n\nThe exploration and preparation of data through exploratory data analysis and necessary data wrangling.\nThe analysis of log files and associated basic data analysis in e-commerce.\nThe analysis of purchase and cancellation behavior using suitable (regression-based) methods.\nThe analysis of customer feedback from web portals through basic text mining techniques."
