In the thesis, supervised by Prof. Dr. Bernd Skiera, I develop and implement an approach to identify unfair treatment in search results. The thesis contributes to the current debate on whether digital platforms abuse their market power. With my systematic and data-driven approach, regulators and businesses can test, if digital platforms such as Amazon provide fair search results — especially if the offers of the platform are in direct competition with the offers of third parties.\nMarketing Department, Goethe University (November 28, 2021): Lukas Jürgensmeier receives Erich Gutenberg Prize for his Thesis, Press Release.\n\n\nStudent of the Year 2021\nAwarded for my work at TechAcademy e.V. by the German National Association for Student Affairs (Deutsches Studentenwerk) and the German Association of University Professors and Lecturers (Deutscher Hochschulverband), 5,000 € prize money.\n\nThe award recognizes students who demonstrate outstanding commitment above and beyond their academic achievements, which should be as unique and innovative as possible. In the unanimous opinion of the six-member DHV/DSW jury, the TechAcademy meets these criteria through its exceptional and exemplary commitment in every respect.\n\n\n“With its initiative, TechAcademy contributes to enabling students from less computer science-related courses of study, in particular, to get started in programming. TechAcademy addresses students in a field that is often closed to many students. This interdisciplinary, self-developed offering for students of all disciplines is exemplary, and it is a lighthouse project for the educationally central topic of digital education. It points the way to the future for self-initiated learning, for the promotion of IT skills through a sense of community,” said DHV President Prof. Dr. Bernhard Kempen and DSW President Prof. Dr. Rolf-Dieter Postlep, jointly explaining the award.\n\nDeutsches Studentenwerk (March 18, 2020): “‘TechAcademy’ der Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main sind Studierende des Jahres”, Press Release.\nGoethe University Frankfurt am Main (March 18, 2020): “‘Studierende des Jahres’ — TechAcademy ausgezeichnet”, Press Release.\n\n\nNorbert-Walter-Prize 2019\nFor the best Master’s-level seminar theses in business and economics at Goethe University for my paper “Un-Black-Boxing Artificial Neural Networks: Predicting and Explaining Bank Customer’s Cross-Sell Likelihood” (second price).

    "text": "Measuring Fair Competition on Digital Platforms\nAuthors: Lukas Jürgensmeier and Bernd Skiera\nStatus: Revise & Resubmit at the Journal of Marketing\n\nAbstract\nProviders of digital platforms commonly recommend specific platform offers, through labels (e.g., “Amazon’s Choice”) or through rankings in search results. However, there is currently no systematic way of verifying that a platform’s recommendations are fair and neutral, based on offers’ merits. This manuscript describes a novel approach to detect discriminatory platform recommendations, by analyzing whether recommendations are dependent on “unfair” factors that do not influence consumers’ utility. We focus on a scenario in which a platform provider serves as a platform actor (e.g., Amazon, which sells products on the Amazon Marketplace platform), and might leverage its position to unfairly promote its own offers. We apply our approach to test for discrimination in search visibility on Amazon Marketplace, in two empirical studies covering more than a million daily observations from three countries. Study A, which focuses on identical offers supplied by multiple sellers, does not find consistent evidence that Amazon’s search engine results discriminate against third-party sellers. Study B, which compares private-label products supplied exclusively by either Amazon or a third party, finds that Amazon’s products are significantly less visible than justified. Our approach can serve as a tool for platform actors, regulators, and lawmakers to test for discrimination on platforms.\nKeywords: Digital Platforms, Amazon, Competition, Antitrust, Search Engines\n\n\nConference Presentations\n\n\n\nConference\nDate\nLocation\nPresenting Author\n\n\n\n\n17th Symposium on Statistical Challenges in Electronic Commerce Research (SCECR 2021)\nJune 2021\nMadrid, Spain\nonline\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\nInteractive Marketing Research Conference (IMRC 2021)\nOctober 2021\nGabelli School of Business, Fordham University, New York City, USA\nonline\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\n13th Paris Conference on Digital Economics 2022\nApril 2022\nTélécom Paris, Paliseau, France\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\nEMAC Doctoral Colloquium 2022\nMay 2022\nCorvinus University, Budapest, Hungary\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\nEMAC Annual Conference 2022\nMay 2022\nCorvinus University, Budapest, Hungary\nBernd Skiera\n\n\nMunich Summer Institute 2022\nJune 2022\nBavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities, Munich, Germany\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\nISMS Marketing Science 2022\nJune 2022\nUniversity of Chicago Booth School of Business, USA\nonline\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\n20th ZEW Conference on the Economics of Information and Communication Technologies\nJuly 2022\nZEW — Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research, Mannheim, Germany\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\nSALTY 2022 — Quantiative Marketing Conference\nSeptember 2022\nWHU — Otto Beisheim School of Management, Düsseldorf, Germany\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding\nThis project is funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft— DFG) through grant number SK 66/8-1 within the project Visibility in Digital Markets: Risks and Economic Consequences."

    "text": "Does Media Reporting Matter for Daily Consumption Choices?\nAuthors: Celina Proffen and Lukas Jürgensmeier\n\nAbstract\nPrevious research has shown that media reporting matters for voting behavior, investment decisions, and even consumer sentiment as measured in surveys. We provide estimates for how media reporting affects actual consumption choices at a daily level, using data on visits to nearly 200,000 restaurants across the US. Exploiting the variation in news coverage about the recent US-China trade conflict, we estimate that a week-long one standard deviation increase in daily reporting negativity about China leads to 1.3 – 3.7% fewer daily visits to the average Chinese restaurant in our sample. We furthermore provide evidence that around 65% of this effect is explained by the chosen reporting tone, which holds important implications for policymakers, publishers, and firms’ branding strategies. We also link our findings to the literature on consumer ethnocentricity and animosity and provide suggestive evidence that media reporting can trigger ethnocentric behavior.\n\n\nConference Presentations\n\n\n\nConference\nDate\nLocation\nPresenting Author\n\n\n\n\nEMAC Doctoral Colloquium 2022\nMay 2022\nCorvinus University, Budapest, Hungary\nCelina Proffen\n\n\nEMAC Annual Conference 2022\nMay 2022\nCorvinus University, Budapest, Hungary\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\nVfS Annual Conference 2022 — Big Data in Economics\nSeptember 11 – 14, 2022\nUniversity of Basel, Switzerland\nCelina Proffen\n\n\nEconomics of Media Workshop: Industrial Organization meets Political Economy\nSeptember 15, 2022\nSmith School of Business, Queen’s University, Kingston, ON, Canada\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding\nThis project is funded by the efl – the Data Science Institute."

However, the first steps in coding can be intimidating and discouraging—primarily if you have never worked with a programming language before. This course aims at providing a results-oriented, applied, and hands-on introduction to the essential parts of a Data Science project in R. We will introduce the libraries and frameworks necessary for your analysis and focus on teaching you the implementation and application of those tools. We’ll present small examples throughout the lecture and provide you with application exercises that you can work on for yourself.\nOur goal is to show you the scope of possibilities within R and leave you with the impression that you can confidently implement your empirical projects in R. We will focus on the Tidyverse ecosystem, a consistent and intuitive framework for building your data analysis from start to finish. After completing this course, you know how to apply the essential Tidyverse tools for everyday Data Science tasks in R—primarily data wrangling, data visualization, and communicating results."

Instead of monotonously walking you through those, we follow a different teaching philosophy.\nEach topic will start with a very friendly and sometimes a bit complicated cake. And you will dive right into it by executing and adapting the code for that “data science cake.”\nFor example, we will show you an advanced visualization right at the beginning of the course and focus on what is possible eventually. While this might appear intimidating at first (“how should I ever be able to code that from scratch?”), we will walk you through the steps and introduce the methods to get there during the course.\nThe course will alternate between short introductions to a concept or method and small do-it-yourself coding exercises. In between the three sessions, you are encouraged to work on provided exercises that further deepen your understanding."
