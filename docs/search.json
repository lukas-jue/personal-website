After co-leading the organization as an executive board member for several years, my current role as an supervisory board member is to ensure TechAcademy’s long-term viability and successful development.\nTechAcademy e.V. is a student initiative at Goethe University Frankfurt training the next digital leaders. Students of any discipline get the opportunity to acquire coding skills in Data Science and Web Development programs. Students apply their acquired tech skills in projects, solving real-world problems digitally.\nIn addition to regular coding meetups, TechAcademy actively supports students in developing and implementing their projects through workshops, lectures, and company visits. In this way, participants gain practical experience in the tech sector while still studying and establish contact with relevant companies. TechAcademy currently provides 100 students per semester with the opportunity to participate in the educational program and counts more than 400 students as alumnae.\nIn addition, TechAcademy organizes the annual TechConference — a digitization conference with high-ranking speakers from business, politics and science.\nFor this voluntary engagement TechAcademy won the national award “Students of the Year 2021,” awarded jointly by the German National Association for Student Affairs (Deutsches Studentenwerk) and the German Association of University Professors and Lecturers (Deutscher Hochschulverband)."

    "text": "Measuring Fair Competition on Digital Platforms\nAuthors: Lukas Jürgensmeier and Bernd Skiera\nStatus: Revise & Resubmit (third round) at the Journal of Marketing\nRead the full working paper on SSRN.\n\nAbstract\nDigital platforms use recommendations to facilitate the exchange between platform actors, such as trade between buyers and sellers. Platform actors expect, and legislators increasingly require that competition, including recommendations, are fair—especially for a market-dominating platform on which self-preferencing could occur. However, testing for fairness on platforms is challenging because offers from competing platform actors usually differ in their attributes, and many distinct fairness definitions exist. This article considers these challenges, develops a five-step approach to measure fair competition through recommendations on digital platforms, and illustrates this approach by conducting two empirical studies. These studies examine Amazon’s search engine recommendations on the Amazon marketplace for more than a million daily observations from three countries. They find no consistent evidence for unfair competition through search engine recommendations. The article also discusses applying the five-step approach in other settings to ensure compliance with new regulations governing fair competition on digital platforms, such as the Digital Markets Act in the European Union or the proposed American Innovation and Choice Online Act in the United States.\nKeywords: Digital Platforms, Amazon, Competition, Fairness, Antitrust, Search Engines, Digital Markets Act, American Innovation and Choice Online Act.\n\n\nConference Presentations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConference\nDate\nLocation\nPresenting Author\n\n\n\n\n17th Symposium on Statistical Challenges in Electronic Commerce Research (SCECR 2021)\nJune 2021\nMadrid, Spain\nonline\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\nInteractive Marketing Research Conference (IMRC 2021)\nOctober 2021\nGabelli School of Business, Fordham University, New York City, United States\nonline\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\n13th Paris Conference on Digital Economics 2022\nApril 2022\nTélécom Paris, Paliseau, France\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\nEMAC Doctoral Colloquium 2022\nMay 2022\nCorvinus University, Budapest, Hungary\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\nEMAC Annual Conference 2022\nMay 2022\nCorvinus University, Budapest,\nBernd Skiera\n\n\nMunich Summer Institute 2022\nJune 2022\nBavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities, Munich, Germany\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\nISMS Marketing Science Conference 2022\nJune 2022\n~ ~University of Chicago Booth School of Business, United States~~\nonline\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\n20th ZEW Conference on the Economics of Information and Communication Technologies\nJuly 2022\nZEW — Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research, Mannheim, Germany\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\nSALTY 2022 — Quantitative Marketing Conference\nSeptember 2022\nWHU — Otto Beisheim School of Management, Düsseldorf, Germany\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\nWISE 2022 — Workshop on Information Systems in Economics\nDecember 2022\nCopenhagen Business School, Copenhagen, Denmark\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\nISMS Marketing Science Conference 2023 (special session for winners of the 2022 ISMS Doctoral Dissertation Proposal Competition)\nJune 2023\nMiami, United States\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding\nThis project is funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft—DFG) through grant number SK 66/8-1 within the project Visibility in Digital Markets: Risks and Economic Consequences."

This study exploits the volatile US-China relations in 2018 and 2019 to analyze whether US consumers reduce their visits to Chinese restaurants when bilateral relations deteriorate. We measure the degree of political conflict through negativity in media reports and rely on smartphone location data to measure daily visits to over 190,000 US restaurants. A deterioration in US-China relations induces a significant decline in visits to Chinese restaurants, while visits to American restaurants increase. We identify consumers’ age, race, and cultural openness to mediate the strength of this effect.\n\n\nConference Presentations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConference\nDate\nLocation\nPresenting Author\n\n\n\n\nEMAC Doctoral Colloquium 2022\nMay 2022\nCorvinus University, Budapest, Hungary\nCelina Proffen\n\n\nEMAC Annual Conference 2022\nMay 2022\nCorvinus University, Budapest, Hungary\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\nVfS Annual Conference 2022\nSeptember 2022\nUniversity of Basel, Switzerland\nCelina Proffen\n\n\nEconomics of Media Workshop: Industrial Organization meets Political Economy\nSeptember 2022\nSmith School of Business, Queen’s University, Kingston, ON, Canada\nLukas Jürgensmeier\n\n\nefl — the Data Science Institute, Jour Fixe\nJanuary 2023\nFrankfurt, Germany\nCelina Proffen\n\n\n\n\n\nFunding\nThis project is funded by the efl – the Data Science Institute."

Nonetheless, offering feedback on students' open-ended analytics tasks is labor-intensive and expensive. This study introduces a web application leveraging generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to autonomously provide feedback on exercises requiring coding, statistics, mathematics, and economic reasoning. We compare the application's feedback with human expert feedback for 510 student responses across various exercise complexities and four application configurations. Our results show that the application using GPT-4 with the correct solution provides nearly unbiased and reasonably accurate evaluations. Specifically, it has a mean error of ‑1.6 points on a 90-point exercise and a mean absolute error of 7.2 points (8 % of total achievable points). While GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 by 26 %, it costs over ten times more. Compared to AI models, human evaluators are the most accurate but are about 170 times costlier than GPT-3.5, 15 times pricier than GPT-4, and require at least 20 times the evaluation duration. While we test the web application in a marketing analytics context, the application does not feature any subject-specific elements beyond the user-supplied exercise and (optionally) a correct solution. Hence, the application is ready to use in other domains beyond marketing analytics."

This exercise combines teaching econometrics to analyze data and substantive marketing to derive managerial insights. The econometric challenge requires students to set up and implement a regression analysis to derive the demand function, detect multicollinearity, and select appropriate data visualizations. The substantive challenge requires deriving optimal pricing decisions and understanding how the parameters of the demand function impact optimal prices and the associated profit. We discuss the exercise’s efficacy as an exam by presenting the distribution of student performance from 134 exam submissions. Beyond assessing students’ learning in an exam, the exercise facilitates teaching as a case study for in-class discussion or an assignment. Under a liberal CC BY license and free of charge, we encourage other educators to use the exercise in their teaching. Beyond the exercise, we provide the necessary data and a sample solution using the statistical programming language R.\nKeywords: Marketing Analytics, Pricing, Teaching, Exercise, Case Study, Data Science\nStatus: Revise and Resubmit the Journal of Marketing Analytics (Special Issue on “Marketing Analytics in Academia: Exploring Effective Pedagogy.”)"
