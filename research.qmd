### Abstract

Does political conflict with another country influence domestic consumers'
daily consumption choices? We exploit the volatile US-China relations in 2018
and 2019 to analyze whether US consumers reduce their visits to Chinese
restaurants when bilateral relations deteriorate. We measure the degree of
political conflict through negativity in media reports and rely on smartphone
location data to measure daily visits to over 190,000 US restaurants.
A deterioration in US-China relations induces a significant decline in visits
not only to Chinese but also to other foreign ethnic restaurants, while visits
to typical American restaurants increase. We identify consumers' age, race, and
cultural openness to moderate the strength of this ethnocentric effect.

## Teaching Marketing Analytics: A Pricing Case Study for Quantitative and Substantive Marketing Skills

Skiera, Bernd and Jürgensmeier, Lukas (2024), "Teaching Marketing Analytics: A Pricing Exercise for Quantitative and Substantive Marketing Skills,"
Journal of Marketing Analytics (forthcoming).

This article describes a data-driven case study for teaching and assessing
students’ skills in marketing analytics, specifically in pricing. This case
study combines teaching econometrics to analyze data and substantive marketing
to derive managerial insights. The econometric challenge requires students to
set up and implement a regression analysis to derive the demand function, detect
multicollinearity, and select appropriate data visualizations. The substantive
challenge requires deriving optimal pricing decisions and understanding how the
parameters of the demand function impact optimal prices and the associated
profit. We test the case study in a marketing analytics exam and discuss the
performance of 134 students. Beyond assessing student performance in an exam,
the case study facilitates teaching through in-class group work or assignments.
Free of charge, under a liberal CC BY license, we encourage other educators to
use the case study in their teaching. We provide the necessary data and a sample
solution using the statistical programming language R.

### Abstract

Digital platforms use recommendations to facilitate exchanges between platform
actors, such as trade between buyers and sellers. Aiming to protect consumers
and guarantee fair competition on platforms, legislators increasingly require
that recommendations on market-dominating platforms be free from
self-preferencing. That is, platforms that also act as sellers (e.g., Amazon)
or information providers (e.g., Google) must not prefer their own offers over
comparable third-party offers. Yet, successful enforcement of self-preferencing
bans—to the potential benefit of consumers and third-party actors—requires
defining and measuring self-preferencing across a platform. In the context of
recommendations through search results, this research contributes by i)
conceptualizing a “recommendation” as an offer’s level of search engine
visibility across an entire platform (instead of its position in specific
search queries, as in previous research); ii) discussing two tests for
self-preferencing, and iii) implementing them in two empirical studies across
three international Amazon marketplaces. Contrary to consumer expectations and
emerging literature, our analysis finds almost no evidence for
self-preferencing. A survey reveals that even if Amazon were proven to engage
in self-preferencing, most consumers would not change their shopping behavior
on the platform—highlighting Amazon’s significant market power and suggesting
the need for robust protections for sellers and consumers.

### Abstract

Detailed feedback on exercises helps learners become proficient in
marketing analytics. However, such feedback is labor-intensive and
expensive for educators. This manuscript introduces a web app leveraging
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) that automatically provides
feedback on complex multimodal exercises requiring coding, statistics,
and economic reasoning. The authors evaluate the performance by
comparing the app\'s quantitative feedback (i.e., points achieved) with
human expert feedback for 4,349 solutions of marketing analytics
exercises. The results show that the app (using GPT-4) provides almost
unbiased evaluations, correlates very highly with (r = .94), and
deviates only 6 % from human evaluations. Experts rate the app\'s
qualitative performance by examining its textual feedback, indicating
that it is mostly correct, sufficient, and appropriate for learners.
Survey responses show that learners highly recommend the app and that
the automated feedback adds value beyond traditional feedback methods.
An advantage of the app is its subject-agnosticism: because it does not
require any subject- or exercise-specific design, it is ready-to-use for
new exercises in marketing analytics and other subjects.

### Abstract
Large digital platforms face intense scrutiny over self-preferencing, which
involves a platform provider preferring its own offers over competitors. On
online marketplaces, also called retail or e-commerce platforms, much of the
academic and regulatory debate focuses on detecting whether the marketplace
provider prefers its own private labels, such as "Amazon Basics" or Walmart's
“Great Value” products. However, we outline, conceptually and empirically, that
self-preferencing can also occur through other dimensions of vertical
integration, namely, retailing and fulfillment. This article contributes by
conceptualizing three dimensions of vertical integration on online
marketplaces---private labels, retailing, and fulfillment, and describes which
international marketplaces vertically integrate to which extent in two empirical
studies. First, we show empirically that the majority of the 20 most-visited
global online marketplaces vertically integrate in all three dimensions,
implying ample opportunities for self-preferencing. Second, we analyze around
600 million offers on eleven international Amazon marketplaces to measure
vertical integration in each dimension, i.e., for which share of offers
self-preferencing could occur. Only 0.02% of all offers consists of an Amazon
private label product, but Amazon is a retailer for around 31% and fulfills
around 38% of all available offers on its marketplaces. While the
self-preferencing debate often focuses on private-label products, we are the
first to present large-scale empirical results showing that self-preferencing
on Amazon could occur most often through retailing and fulfillment because it
affects much larger shares of offers. We are also the first to measure these
shares’ variation across countries and to relate them to regulatory
environments.
