My research investigates economic phenomena in the digital economy. I do
so using novel big data sources and applying modern statistical methods.

On this website, you will find a summary of my current research projects
that use search engine and Amazon product data to assess [fair
competition on digital
platforms](research.qmd#measuring-fair-competition-on-digital-platforms),
as well as smartphone location data and large amounts of unstructured
newspaper articles to estimate the [effect of political conflict on
consumption](research.qmd#do-political-conflicts-influence-daily-consumption-choices).

### Abstract

Digital platforms use recommendations to facilitate the exchange between
platform actors, such as trade between buyers and sellers. Platform
actors expect, and legislators increasingly require that competition,
including recommendations, are fair---especially for a market-dominating
platform on which self-preferencing could occur. However, testing for
fairness on platforms is challenging because offers from competing
platform actors usually differ in their attributes, and many distinct
fairness definitions exist. This article considers these challenges,
develops a five-step approach to measure fair competition through
recommendations on digital platforms, and illustrates this approach by
conducting two empirical studies. These studies examine Amazon's search
engine recommendations on the Amazon marketplace for more than a million
daily observations from three countries. They find no consistent
evidence for unfair competition through search engine recommendations.
The article also discusses applying the five-step approach in other
settings to ensure compliance with new regulations governing fair
competition on digital platforms, such as the Digital Markets Act in the
European Union or the proposed American Innovation and Choice Online Act
in the United States.

### Abstract

Does political conflict with a foreign country influence domestic
consumers' daily consumption choices? This study exploits the volatile
US-China relations in 2018 and 2019 to analyze whether US consumers
reduce their visits to Chinese restaurants when bilateral relations
deteriorate. We measure the degree of political conflict through
negativity in media reports and rely on smartphone location data to
measure daily visits to over 190,000 US restaurants. A deterioration in
US-China relations induces a significant decline in visits to Chinese
restaurants, while visits to American restaurants increase. We identify
consumers' age, race, and cultural openness to mediate the strength of
this effect.

# Early-Stage Research Without Working Paper

## Using Generative AI to Provide Scalable Feedback to Students in Marketing Analytics

*Authors:* Lukas Jürgensmeier and [Bernd
Skiera](https://www.marketing.uni-frankfurt.de/abteilungen/marketing/professoren/skiera/prof-dr-bernd-skiera.html)

*Status:* In progress, initial draft of working paper estimated January

### Abstract

The increasing role of data analytics in marketing underscores the
importance of teaching marketing analytics in higher education.
Nonetheless, offering feedback on students\' open-ended analytics tasks
is labor-intensive and expensive. This study introduces a web
application leveraging generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to
autonomously provide feedback on exercises requiring coding, statistics,
mathematics, and economic reasoning. We compare the application\'s
feedback with human expert feedback for 510 student responses across
various exercise complexities and four application configurations. Our
results show that the application using GPT-4 with the correct solution
provides nearly unbiased and reasonably accurate evaluations.
Specifically, it has a mean error of ‑1.6 points on a 90-point exercise
and a mean absolute error of 7.2 points (8 % of total achievable
points). While GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 by 26 %, it costs over ten
times more. Compared to AI models, human evaluators are the most
accurate but are about 170 times costlier than GPT-3.5, 15 times pricier
than GPT-4, and require at least 20 times the evaluation duration. While
we test the web application in a marketing analytics context, the
application does not feature any subject-specific elements beyond the
user-supplied exercise and (optionally) a correct solution. Hence, the
application is ready to use in other domains beyond marketing analytics.

## Teaching Marketing Analytics: A Pricing Exercise for Quantitative and Substantive Marketing Skills

*Authors:* [Bernd
Skiera](https://www.marketing.uni-frankfurt.de/abteilungen/marketing/professoren/skiera/prof-dr-bernd-skiera.html)
and Lukas Jürgensmeier

This article describes a data-driven exercise for teaching and assessing
students\' skills in marketing analytics, specifically in pricing. This
exercise combines teaching econometrics to analyze data and substantive
marketing to derive managerial insights. The econometric challenge
requires students to set up and implement a regression analysis to
derive the demand function, detect multicollinearity, and select
appropriate data visualizations. The substantive challenge requires
deriving optimal pricing decisions and understanding how the parameters
of the demand function impact optimal prices and the associated profit.
The exercise serves as a case study for in-class discussion, an
assignment, or an in-class or take-home exam to assess students\'
skills. Under a liberal CC BY license and free of charge, we encourage
other educators to use the exercise in their teaching. Beyond the
exercise, we provide the necessary data and a sample solution using the
statistical programming language R.
