## Do Political Conflicts Influence Daily Consumption Choices? Evidence from US-China Relations

### Abstract

Does political conflict with another country influence domestic consumers'
daily consumption choices? We exploit the volatile US-China relations in 2018
and 2019 to analyze whether US consumers reduce their visits to Chinese
restaurants when bilateral relations deteriorate. We measure the degree of
political conflict through negativity in media reports and rely on smartphone
location data to measure daily visits to over 190,000 US restaurants.
A deterioration in US-China relations induces a significant decline in visits
not only to Chinese but also to other foreign ethnic restaurants, while visits
to typical American restaurants increase. We identify consumers' age, race, and
cultural openness to moderate the strength of this ethnocentric effect.

### Abstract

Digital platforms use recommendations to facilitate exchanges between platform
actors, such as trade between buyers and sellers. Aiming to protect consumers
and guarantee fair competition on platforms, legislators increasingly require
that recommendations on market-dominating platforms be free from
self-preferencing. That is, platforms that also act as sellers (e.g., Amazon)
or information providers (e.g., Google) must not prefer their own offers over
comparable third-party offers. Yet, successful enforcement of self-preferencing
bans—to the potential benefit of consumers and third-party actors—requires
defining and measuring self-preferencing across a platform. In the context of
recommendations through search results, this research contributes by i)
conceptualizing a “recommendation” as an offer’s level of search engine
visibility across an entire platform (instead of its position in specific
search queries, as in previous research); ii) discussing two tests for
self-preferencing, and iii) implementing them in two empirical studies across
three international Amazon marketplaces. Contrary to consumer expectations and
emerging literature, our analysis finds almost no evidence for
self-preferencing. A survey reveals that even if Amazon were proven to engage
in self-preferencing, most consumers would not change their shopping behavior
on the platform—highlighting Amazon’s significant market power and suggesting
the need for robust protections for sellers and consumers.

### Abstract

Detailed feedback on exercises helps learners become proficient in
marketing analytics. However, such feedback is labor-intensive and
expensive for educators. This manuscript introduces a web app leveraging
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) that automatically provides
feedback on complex multimodal exercises requiring coding, statistics,
and economic reasoning. The authors evaluate the performance by
comparing the app\'s quantitative feedback (i.e., points achieved) with
human expert feedback for 4,349 solutions of marketing analytics
exercises. The results show that the app (using GPT-4) provides almost
unbiased evaluations, correlates very highly with (r = .94), and
deviates only 6 % from human evaluations. Experts rate the app\'s
qualitative performance by examining its textual feedback, indicating
that it is mostly correct, sufficient, and appropriate for learners.
Survey responses show that learners highly recommend the app and that
the automated feedback adds value beyond traditional feedback methods.
An advantage of the app is its subject-agnosticism: because it does not
require any subject- or exercise-specific design, it is ready-to-use for
new exercises in marketing analytics and other subjects.

## Teaching Marketing Analytics: A Pricing Exercise for Quantitative and Substantive Marketing Skills

*Authors:* [Bernd
Skiera](https://www.marketing.uni-frankfurt.de/abteilungen/marketing/professoren/skiera/prof-dr-bernd-skiera.html)
and Lukas Jürgensmeier.

This article describes a data-driven exercise for teaching and assessing
students' skills in marketing analytics, specifically in pricing. This
exercise combines teaching econometrics to analyze data and substantive
marketing to derive managerial insights. The econometric challenge
requires students to set up and implement a regression analysis to
derive the demand function, detect multicollinearity, and select
appropriate data visualizations. The substantive challenge requires
deriving optimal pricing decisions and understanding how the parameters
of the demand function impact optimal prices and the associated profit.
We discuss the exercise's efficacy as an exam by presenting the
distribution of student performance from 134 exam submissions. Beyond
assessing students' learning in an exam, the exercise facilitates
teaching as a case study for in-class discussion or an assignment. Under
a liberal CC BY license and free of charge, we encourage other educators
to use the exercise in their teaching. Beyond the exercise, we provide
the necessary data and a sample solution using the statistical
programming language R.
