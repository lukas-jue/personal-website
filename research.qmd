## Generative AI for Scalable Feedback to Multimodal Exercises

Jürgensmeier, Lukas and [Bernd Skiera](https://www.marketing.uni-frankfurt.de/abteilungen/marketing/professoren/skiera/prof-dr-bernd-skiera.html) (2024), "Generative AI for Scalable Feedback to Multimodal Exercises," International Journal of Research in Marketing, forthcoming, [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijresmar.2024.05.005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijresmar.2024.05.005).

**Abstract**

Detailed feedback on exercises helps learners become proficient but is time-consuming for educators and, thus, hardly scalable. This manuscript evaluates how well Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides automated feedback on complex multimodal exercises requiring coding, statistics, and economic reasoning. Besides providing this technology through an easily accessible web application, this article evaluates the technology’s performance by comparing the quantitative feedback (i.e., points achieved) from Generative AI models with human expert feedback for 4,349 solutions to marketing analytics exercises. The results show that automated feedback produced by Generative AI (GPT-4) provides almost unbiased evaluations while correlating highly with (r = 0.94) and deviating only 6 % from human evaluations. GPT-4 performs best among seven Generative AI models, albeit at the highest cost. Comparing the models’ performance with costs shows that GPT-4, Mistral Large, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.0 Pro dominate three other Generative AI models (Claude 3 Sonnet, GPT-3.5, and Gemini 1.5 Pro). Expert assessment of the qualitative feedback (i.e., the AI’s textual response) indicates that it is mostly correct, sufficient, and appropriate for learners. A survey of marketing analytics learners shows that they highly recommend the app and its Generative AI feedback. An advantage of the app is its subject-agnosticism—it does not require any subject- or exercise-specific training. Thus, it is immediately usable for new exercises in marketing analytics and other subjects.

## Do Political Conflicts Influence Daily Consumption Choices? Evidence from US-China Relations

[Proffen, Celina](https://www.celinaproffen.com/)  and Lukas Jürgensmeier (2024), "Do political conflicts influence daily consumption choices? Evidence from US-China relations," Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 220, pp. 660-674, [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2024.02.031](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2024.02.031), shared first authorship.

**Abstract**

Does political conflict with another country influence domestic consumers'
daily consumption choices? We exploit the volatile US-China relations in 2018
and 2019 to analyze whether US consumers reduce their visits to Chinese
restaurants when bilateral relations deteriorate. We measure the degree of
political conflict through negativity in media reports and rely on smartphone
location data to measure daily visits to over 190,000 US restaurants.
A deterioration in US-China relations induces a significant decline in visits
not only to Chinese but also to other foreign ethnic restaurants, while visits
to typical American restaurants increase. We identify consumers' age, race, and
cultural openness to moderate the strength of this ethnocentric effect.

## Opportunities for Self-Preferencing in International Online Marketplaces

Jürgensmeier, Lukas, Jan Bischoff, and [Bernd Skiera](https://www.marketing.uni-frankfurt.de/abteilungen/marketing/professoren/skiera/prof-dr-bernd-skiera.html) (2024), "Opportunities for Self-Preferencing in International Online Marketplaces", International Marketing Review, forthcoming.

**Abstract**

Large digital platforms face intense scrutiny over self-preferencing, which involves a platform provider favoring its own offers over those of competitors. In online marketplaces, also called retail or e-commerce platforms, much of the academic and regulatory debate focuses on determining whether the marketplace provider gives preference to its own private labels, such as "Amazon Basics" or Walmart's "Great Value" products. However, we outline, both conceptually and empirically, that self-preferencing can also occur through other dimensions of vertical integration—namely, retailing and fulfillment.
This article contributes by conceptualizing three dimensions of vertical integration in online marketplaces—private labels, retailing, and fulfillment. Then, two studies empirically assess (i) which of the 20 most-visited global online marketplaces vertically integrate which dimension and (ii) which share of 600 million available offers are vertically integrated to which degree in eleven international Amazon marketplaces.
The majority of the leading marketplaces vertically integrate all three dimensions, implying ample opportunities for self-preferencing. Across international Amazon marketplaces, only 0.02% of available offers consist of an Amazon private-label product. However, Amazon is a retailer for around 31% and fulfills around 38% of all available offers in its marketplaces. Hence, self-preferencing on Amazon can occur most frequently through retailing and fulfillment but comparatively infrequently through private-label offers. Still, these shares differ substantially by country—every second offer is vertically integrated in the US, but only one in ten in India.
Most of the self-preferencing debate often focuses on private-label products. Instead, we present large-scale empirical results showing that self-preferencing on Amazon could occur most often through retailing and fulfillment because these channels affect much larger shares of offers. We also measure the variation of these shares across countries and relate them to regulatory environments.


## Teaching Marketing Analytics: A Pricing Case Study for Quantitative and Substantive Marketing Skills

The case study, solution, and data is available through [GitHub](https://github.com/lukas-jue/marketing-analytics-exercise).

**Abstract**

This article describes a data-driven case study for teaching and assessing
students’ skills in marketing analytics, specifically in pricing. This case
study combines teaching econometrics to analyze data and substantive marketing
to derive managerial insights. The econometric challenge requires students to
set up and implement a regression analysis to derive the demand function, detect
multicollinearity, and select appropriate data visualizations. The substantive
challenge requires deriving optimal pricing decisions and understanding how the
parameters of the demand function impact optimal prices and the associated
profit. We test the case study in a marketing analytics exam and discuss the
performance of 134 students. Beyond assessing student performance in an exam,
the case study facilitates teaching through in-class group work or assignments.
Free of charge, under a liberal CC BY license, we encourage other educators to
use the case study in their teaching. We provide the necessary data and a sample
solution using the statistical programming language R.

**Abstract**

In addition to traditional educational institutions, volunteer organizations play an important role, especially in digital education. This article shows which volunteer-organized offerings exist in Germany, discusses the innovative concepts behind them, and illustrates how traditional educational institutions can learn from this volunteer engagement. To this end, the authors present the results of a survey of 19 organizations and two exemplary projects in case studies, and recommend three concrete actions for education policy based on these results.

**Abstract**

Digital platforms use recommendations to facilitate exchanges between platform
actors, such as trade between buyers and sellers. Aiming to protect consumers
and guarantee fair competition on platforms, legislators increasingly require
that recommendations on market-dominating platforms be free from
self-preferencing. That is, platforms that also act as sellers (e.g., Amazon)
or information providers (e.g., Google) must not prefer their own offers over
comparable third-party offers. Yet, successful enforcement of self-preferencing
bans—to the potential benefit of consumers and third-party actors—requires
defining and measuring self-preferencing across a platform. In the context of
recommendations through search results, this research contributes by i)
conceptualizing a “recommendation” as an offer’s level of search engine
visibility across an entire platform (instead of its position in specific
search queries, as in previous research); ii) discussing two tests for
self-preferencing, and iii) implementing them in two empirical studies across
three international Amazon marketplaces. Contrary to consumer expectations and
emerging literature, our analysis finds almost no evidence for
self-preferencing. A survey reveals that even if Amazon were proven to engage
in self-preferencing, most consumers would not change their shopping behavior
on the platform—highlighting Amazon’s significant market power and suggesting
the need for robust protections for sellers and consumers.

## `keepar`: An R Package to Identify, Acquire, and Transform Online Marketplace Data for Social Science Research

**Authors:** Lukas Jürgensmeier

**Status:** Package available at [GitHub](https://github.com/lukas-jue/keepar); draft working paper available upon request.

**Abstract**

Researchers frequently use online marketplace data for social science
research. However, obtaining and processing such data is cumbersome, and
either involves web scraping or access to a pre-existing database. One
such a database is the commercial data provider Keepa.com, which tracks
Amazon products over time. While such database is accessible via API,
identifying and processing the relevant data---into a suitable format
for social science research---requires significant effort. This article
introduces the `keepar` package, an `R` package designed to simplify
this data acquisition and transformation process. Through an
illustrative research project analyzing the market for rubber ducks on
Amazon, this article explains how to use the package to obtain and
transform the Keepa.com data. Making this package available open source,
this article contributes to making this data source more widely
available to social science researchers.
