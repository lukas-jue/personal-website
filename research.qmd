My research investigates economic phenomena in the digital economy. I do
so using novel big data sources and applying modern statistical methods.

On this website, you will find a summary of my current research projects
that use search engine and Amazon product data to assess [fair
competition on digital
platforms](research.qmd#measuring-fair-competition-on-digital-platforms),
as well as smartphone location data and large amounts of unstructured
newspaper articles to estimate the [effect of political conflict on
consumption](research.qmd#do-political-conflicts-influence-daily-consumption-choices).

### Abstract

Digital platforms use recommendations to facilitate the exchange between
platform actors, such as trade between buyers and sellers. Platform
actors expect, and legislators increasingly require that competition,
including recommendations, are fair---especially for a market-dominating
platform on which self-preferencing could occur. However, testing for
fairness on platforms is challenging because offers from competing
platform actors usually differ in their attributes, and many distinct
fairness definitions exist. This article considers these challenges,
develops a five-step approach to measure fair competition through
recommendations on digital platforms, and illustrates this approach by
conducting two empirical studies. These studies examine Amazon's search
engine recommendations on the Amazon marketplace for more than a million
daily observations from three countries. They find no consistent
evidence for unfair competition through search engine recommendations.
The article also discusses applying the five-step approach in other
settings to ensure compliance with new regulations governing fair
competition on digital platforms, such as the Digital Markets Act in the
European Union or the proposed American Innovation and Choice Online Act
in the United States.

**Keywords:** Digital Platforms, Amazon, Competition, Fairness,
Antitrust, Search Engines, Digital Markets Act, American Innovation and
Choice Online Act.

## Do Political Conflicts Influence Daily Consumption Choices? Evidence from US-China Relations

*Authors:* [Celina Proffen](https://www.celinaproffen.com/) and Lukas
Jürgensmeier (equal co-authorship)

*Status:* Working paper (draft available upon request)

### Abstract

Does political conflict with a foreign country influence domestic
consumers' daily consumption choices? This study exploits the volatile
US-China relations in 2018 and 2019 to analyze whether US consumers
reduce their visits to Chinese restaurants when bilateral relations
deteriorate. We measure the degree of political conflict through
negativity in media reports and rely on smartphone location data to
measure daily visits to over 190,000 US restaurants. A deterioration in
US-China relations induces a significant decline in visits to Chinese
restaurants, while visits to American restaurants increase. We identify
consumers' age, race, and cultural openness to mediate the strength of
this effect.
