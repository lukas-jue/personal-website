My research investigates economic phenomena in the digital economy. I do
so using novel big data sources and applying modern statistical methods.

On this website, you will find a summary of my current research projects
that use search engine and Amazon product data to assess [fair
competition on digital
platforms](research.qmd#measuring-fair-competition-on-digital-platforms),
as well as smartphone location data and large amounts of unstructured
newspaper articles to estimate the [effect of political conflict on
consumption](research.qmd#do-political-conflicts-influence-daily-consumption-choices).

### Abstract

Digital platforms use recommendations to facilitate the exchange between
platform actors, such as trade between buyers and sellers. Platform
actors expect, and legislators increasingly require that competition,
including recommendations, are fair---especially for a market-dominating
platform on which self-preferencing could occur. However, testing for
fairness on platforms is challenging because offers from competing
platform actors usually differ in their attributes, and many distinct
fairness definitions exist. This article considers these challenges,
develops a five-step approach to measure fair competition through
recommendations on digital platforms, and illustrates this approach by
conducting two empirical studies. These studies examine Amazon's search
engine recommendations on the Amazon marketplace for more than a million
daily observations from three countries. They find no consistent
evidence for unfair competition through search engine recommendations.
The article also discusses applying the five-step approach in other
settings to ensure compliance with new regulations governing fair
competition on digital platforms, such as the Digital Markets Act in the
European Union or the proposed American Innovation and Choice Online Act
in the United States.

## Do Political Conflicts Influence Daily Consumption Choices? Evidence from US-China Relations

### Abstract

Does political conflict with another country influence domestic consumers'
daily consumption choices? We exploit the volatile US-China relations in 2018
and 2019 to analyze whether US consumers reduce their visits to Chinese
restaurants when bilateral relations deteriorate. We measure the degree of
political conflict through negativity in media reports and rely on smartphone
location data to measure daily visits to over 190,000 US restaurants.
A deterioration in US-China relations induces a significant decline in visits
not only to Chinese but also to other foreign ethnic restaurants, while visits
to typical American restaurants increase. We identify consumers' age, race,
and cultural openness to moderate the strength of this ethnocentric effect.

### Abstract

Detailed feedback on exercises helps learners become proficient in
marketing analytics. However, such feedback is labor-intensive and
expensive for educators. This manuscript introduces a web app leveraging
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) that automatically provides
feedback on complex multimodal exercises requiring coding, statistics,
and economic reasoning. The authors evaluate the performance by
comparing the app\'s quantitative feedback (i.e., points achieved) with
human expert feedback for 4,349 solutions of marketing analytics
exercises. The results show that the app (using GPT-4) provides almost
unbiased evaluations, correlates very highly with (r = .94), and
deviates only 6 % from human evaluations. Experts rate the app\'s
qualitative performance by examining its textual feedback, indicating
that it is mostly correct, sufficient, and appropriate for learners.
Survey responses show that learners highly recommend the app and that
the automated feedback adds value beyond traditional feedback methods.
An advantage of the app is its subject-agnosticism: because it does not
require any subject- or exercise-specific design, it is ready-to-use for
new exercises in marketing analytics and other subjects.

## Teaching Marketing Analytics: A Pricing Exercise for Quantitative and Substantive Marketing Skills

*Authors:* [Bernd
Skiera](https://www.marketing.uni-frankfurt.de/abteilungen/marketing/professoren/skiera/prof-dr-bernd-skiera.html)
and Lukas Jürgensmeier

This article describes a data-driven exercise for teaching and assessing
students' skills in marketing analytics, specifically in pricing. This
exercise combines teaching econometrics to analyze data and substantive
marketing to derive managerial insights. The econometric challenge
requires students to set up and implement a regression analysis to
derive the demand function, detect multicollinearity, and select
appropriate data visualizations. The substantive challenge requires
deriving optimal pricing decisions and understanding how the parameters
of the demand function impact optimal prices and the associated profit.
We discuss the exercise's efficacy as an exam by presenting the
distribution of student performance from 134 exam submissions. Beyond
assessing students' learning in an exam, the exercise facilitates
teaching as a case study for in-class discussion or an assignment. Under
a liberal CC BY license and free of charge, we encourage other educators
to use the exercise in their teaching. Beyond the exercise, we provide
the necessary data and a sample solution using the statistical
programming language R.
