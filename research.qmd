My research investigates economic phenomena in the digital economy. I do
so using novel big data sources and applying modern statistical methods.

On this website, you will find a summary of my current research projects
that use search engine and Amazon product data to assess [fair
competition on digital
platforms](research.qmd#measuring-fair-competition-on-digital-platforms),
as well as smartphone location data and large amounts of unstructured
newspaper articles to estimate the [effect of political conflict on
consumption](research.qmd#do-political-conflicts-influence-daily-consumption-choices).

### Abstract

Digital platforms use recommendations to facilitate the exchange between
platform actors, such as buyers and sellers. Platform actors expect and
legislators increasingly demand that competition, including
recommendations, is fair, especially for a market-dominating platform on
which self-preferencing could occur. However, testing for fairness on
platforms is challenging because offers from competing platform actors
usually differ in their characteristics, and many distinct fairness
definitions exist. This article considers these challenges and develops
a five-step approach to measure fair competition through recommendations
on digital platforms. The article illustrates this approach by
conducting two empirical studies that examine Amazon's search engine
recommendations on the Amazon marketplace for more than a million daily
observations from three countries. It finds no consistent evidence for
unfair competition in these studies. The article also discusses applying
the five-step approach in other settings to ensure compliance with new
regulations governing fair competition on digital platforms, such as the
Digital Markets Act.

## Do Political Conflicts Influence Daily Consumption Choices?

*Authors:* [Celina Proffen](https://www.celinaproffen.com/) and Lukas
Jürgensmeier

*Status:* Working paper (available upon request)

### Abstract

Political conflict is a fixture of modern democracies. Such conflict
shapes societal and political outcomes. But does political conflict with
a foreign county also influence domestic consumers' daily consumption
choices? This study investigates whether consumers boycott goods
associated with the opposing country in a setting where the conflict
does not directly influence the characteristics of these focal goods.
More concretely, we use the US-China trade conflict to analyze whether
consumers reduce their visits to Chinese restaurants in the US when
political relations deteriorate. We measure the degree of political
conflict through the negativity in media reports and rely on smartphone
location data of more than 11 million devices to proxy daily visits to
over 193,926 restaurants in the US. We find that a deterioration in
US-China relations induces a statistically and economically significant
decline in visits to Chinese restaurants relative to non-Chinese
restaurants in the US. At the same time, visits to other foreign
cuisines also decrease substantially, while visits to traditional
American restaurants increase. We interpret these results as evidence
that reporting on international conflicts triggers ethnocentric consumer
behavior.
