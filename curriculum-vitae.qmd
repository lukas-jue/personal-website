## Honors & Awards

#### **Erich-Gutenberg-Award 2021**

Awarded for my Master's Thesis **Measuring Fair Competition on Digital Platforms: Visibility as a Novel Metric in Antitrust Cases**.

The [Erich-Gutenberg-Arbeitsgemeinschaft](https://www.erich-gutenberg-arbeitsgemeinschaft.de/) honors a "qualitatively remarkable theses on the solution of decision problems in companies" once a year. In the thesis, supervised by Prof. Dr. Bernd Skiera, I develop and implement an approach to identify unfair treatment in search results. The thesis contributes to the current debate on whether digital platforms abuse their market power. With my systematic and data-driven approach, regulators and businesses can test, if digital platforms such as Amazon provide fair search results --- especially if the offers of the platform are in direct competition with the offers of third parties.

Marketing Department, Goethe University (November 28, 2021): [Lukas Jürgensmeier receives Erich Gutenberg Prize for his Thesis](https://www.marketing.uni-frankfurt.de/en/departments/marketing/news/details/article/lukas-juergensmeier-receives-erich-gutenberg-prize-for-his-thesis.html), Press Release.

#### Student of the Year 2021

Awarded for my work at [TechAcademy e.V.](https://tech-academy.io/) by the German National Association for Student Affairs (Deutsches Studentenwerk) and the German Association of University Professors and Lecturers (Deutscher Hochschulverband).

> The award recognizes students who demonstrate outstanding commitment above and beyond their academic achievements, which should be as unique and innovative as possible. In the unanimous opinion of the six-member DHV/DSW jury, the TechAcademy meets these criteria through its exceptional and exemplary commitment in every respect.

> "With its initiative, TechAcademy contributes to enabling students from less computer science-related courses of study, in particular, to get started in programming. TechAcademy addresses students in a field that is often closed to many students. This interdisciplinary, self-developed offering for students of all disciplines is exemplary, and it is a lighthouse project for the educationally central topic of digital education. It points the way to the future for self-initiated learning, for the promotion of IT skills through a sense of community," said DHV President Prof. Dr. Bernhard Kempen and DSW President Prof. Dr. Rolf-Dieter Postlep, jointly explaining the award.
